soooooooooo we have to make 2 models

and then one for applications for storing the application fields and rendering the form in application page


Model for Application

relation with other models:
it will be like the contacts model, it will have relation with the user table and
each user shall have only one job application per job role(like each user shall have only one contact per listing)
also every application must have connection with one job not many(like every listing with one realtor)

hire reason:why should we hire you??[text]


after making models and forms we need to add 2 functions for each model: get and post
get for retrieving blank form and filling it up, post for storing it in database
jobform to be filled up first by admins either from admin area or from our adminArea(FFS CHANGE THE GODDAMN NAME)
then the application can be filled up by selecting the job in the first field
later we can automate it to accept the form automatically using the request.path and not include it inside the application form
